<h1>The Best Movies According to King Welton </h1>
    
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Avengers</h3>
    <p>The best action packed hero movie with an emaculate promise to its sequels that didn't dissapoint! </p> 

    <h3>Pursuit of happiness</h3>
    <p>Talk about drama and motivation? This one tops it all with my all time favorite actor Will Smith. </p>

    <h3>The Dictator</h3>
    <p>Warning! If you're too sensitive then this is not your cup of tea. The most outrageous comedy movie that with its dark humor and to certainly keep you glued to the screen with endless laughter. </p>
